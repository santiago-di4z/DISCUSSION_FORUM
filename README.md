# DISCUSSION_FORUM
**Discussion Forum built with Django.**

This project implements a multi-board discussion platform inspired by imageboards such as 4chan.
Users can register, create threads, comment on existing threads, and navigate topic-specific boards.
The system includes thread lifecycle management, popularity ranking, and user-tagging features (OP).
